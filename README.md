# md-todo

This is a demo todo-app using [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) and [Aurelia Materialize bridge](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-materialize-bridge).
It's a test application to ensure Materialize bridge works with the latest Mterialize anc CLI versions.

Current features include:
- Aurelia i18n used with Materialize components

At the moment, it's a very basic app which will always be updated to the latest Aurelia CLI, Materialize and bridge versions.

Over time, it will be using some more "advanced" techniques which go beyond some tutorials like Aurelia's [Contact Manager Tutorial](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/framework/latest/contact-manager-tutorial) or [Materialize bridge tutorial](https://aurelia-ui-toolkits.gitbooks.io/materialize-bridge-docs/content/app_developers_tutorial/introduction.html).
